## welcome

hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!! my name’s miguel. i’m 14 and this is my tiny corner of the internet – a quiet place for tangled thoughts, hidden truths, and everything i don’t want to perform for. this space isn’t here to impress; it’s here to release.

i write about what i see, what i live, and what no one seems to notice. pretending everything makes sense feels worse than admitting it doesn’t.
